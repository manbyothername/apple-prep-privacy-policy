      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how the mobile application (“the App”) handles information when you use it.
        The App is an educational exam-preparation application intended for adult users.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Scope</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the App on all supported platforms, including Android and iOS.</p>

      <h2>2. No User Accounts</h2>
      <p>
        The App does not require users to create accounts, log in, or provide personal identification such as names,
        email addresses, phone numbers, or payment information.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Information Collected Automatically</h2>
      <h3>Advertising Services</h3>
      <p>
        The App uses Google AdMob, a third-party advertising service provided by Google LLC, to display advertisements.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Advertising ID</li>
        <li>Approximate location (such as country or region)</li>
        <li>App interaction data (for example, ad impressions and engagement)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This data is collected and processed by Google in accordance with its own privacy policies.
        The developer does not directly access, control, or store this data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google’s privacy policy:
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        The App does not sell personal data. Information collected through advertising services may be shared with
        Google and its advertising partners solely for advertising delivery, measurement, and fraud prevention.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        The App does not maintain servers or databases containing personal user data.
        Any data collected by third-party services such as Google AdMob is retained according to their policies.
      </p>

      <h2>6. User Choices</h2>
      <p>
        Users may reset or limit the use of their Advertising ID through their device settings.
        Uninstalling the App removes any locally stored app data from the device.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The App is intended for users 18 years of age and older.
        It is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal data from children.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Security</h2>
      <p>
        Third-party services used by the App employ industry-standard security measures,
        including encryption in transit.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.
        Changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date above.
      </p>
